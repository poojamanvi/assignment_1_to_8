        <h3>FOOD LOVER !!!</h3>
     <p>According to Executive Chef Ankit Mangla from Premium Plaza Lounge, "Haryana is an extremely rich state when it comes to agriculture and cattle. So you will see people there growing and cooking their own food. They have large areas of land and use it for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. No wonder they live simply and eat simple homegrown food." There is no dearth of dairy products as the Haryanvis believe in consuming the purest form of milk by petting cows and buffaloes at homes. People here make their own butter and ghee. In most homes, nooni and tindi ghee, which is a fresh home-made butter, is churned daily.</p>
